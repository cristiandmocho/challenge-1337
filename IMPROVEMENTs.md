# Improvements

With more time, and certainly a team of good professionals working with me, I'd be working on a few improvements to this code:

- Replace `writeFileSync` and `readFileSync` for their async equivalents;
- Replace the JSON file with a proper database;
- Proper HTTP Verbs for the endpoints (PATCH, DELETE etc.);
- Better test coverage
